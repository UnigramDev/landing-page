            Unigram is not just the result of a few passionate developers. Since day one, 
            Unigram is a community driven project and it continues to grow thanks to its 
            large number of fans and enthusiasts.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this reason we created the <b>Unigram Insiders Group</b>, a public group
            where all enthusiasts can gather and talk about our favorite Windows messaging
            app.
          </p>
          <p>
            But what can you do in the group?
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>
                  Talk with the developers
                </b>
                <br/>
                Give feedback on the app, report bugs and get support directly from the 
                developers or from experienced users.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>
                  Discuss ideas, features and the future of Unigram
                </b>
                <br/>
                Share your ideas on how you think Unigram can become an even better app.
                Any kind of input helps!
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>
                  Get early builds and sneak peeks
                </b>
                <br/>
                Sneak peeks and early builds are regularly shared by the developers to get
                an initial feedback from you.
              </li>
